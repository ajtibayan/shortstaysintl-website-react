While 99% of the time we get great guests, even the 1% that gave us issues, they are able to work with the airbnb aircover team to remove a retaliation review + get back money for any damages created by the guests. Regardless of the situation, we feel they will always try their best to find the best solutions. We highly recommend using their services."',
