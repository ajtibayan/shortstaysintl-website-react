            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Mï»¿ai & John, co-founders of the company, are travel professionals
              and 12 years ago, on a trip to Montreal, they decided to book an
              Airbnb stay vs going to a hotel as they needed more space to cook
              and feel at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a great experience with a host, they saw an opportunity to
              create an extra income stream to support their travels. A few
              years later, they became a host on Airbnb, renting out their tiny
              apartment in downtown Toronto.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was an entirely new experience and throughout their first 2
              years, they made a lot of mistakes, but they quickly learned and
              before you know it, became Superhosts and saw the potential of
              short-term rental as solutions for various types of owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seeing how they are experts at renting out their properties, they
              were introduced to a local realtor who was looking for help with a
              few investment properties for short-term rental.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was how they started. Since 2019, they grew the company to
              hosting over 40 listings and have hosted over thousands of guests
              all across the GTA and surrounding areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              They continue to invest in new technology, softwares, education
              and growing the team to help maximize profitability for their
              clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              In , they get so many requests from owners who were making
              mistakes trying to do short-term rental on their own, they decided
              to launch a free monthly short-term rental workshop series as a
              way to give back and support others who are interested in learning
              how to get into the industry.
